## Tech Stack

The Todo App was built using the following technologies:

* Vue 3: A popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
* Pinia: A state management library for Vue 3 that provides a simple and intuitive API.
* Vuetify: A Material Design component library for Vue 3 that provides a wide range of UI elements and patterns.
* SCSS: A preprocessor for CSS that allows you to write more efficient and maintainable styles.
* Vite: A build tool that enables fast and efficient development workflows by leveraging the native module system of modern browsers.
* @formkit/auto-animate: A library that simplifies the implementation of complex animations in Vue 3 by automatically managing transitions between different states of a component (used in todo lists in mobile view).

With this powerful combination of technologies, the Todo App provides a fast, responsive, and visually appealing user experience. Vue 3 and Pinia work together seamlessly to provide efficient state management and reactive updates, while Vuetify provides a comprehensive set of UI components that help ensure a consistent and polished look and feel. Additionally, SCSS makes it easy to write and maintain CSS styles by providing useful features such as variables, mixins, and nesting.
